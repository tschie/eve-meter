# Usage

Install Rainmeter if not already installed.

Download the package from the releases and install it or download this repo and add the Hud ini skin to Rainmeter.

See the Variables.inc file for user-configurable variables and Measures.inc for all measures. Note that the default variables/measures may not work on every system. Some default measures make use of [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/). It is highly recommended to install this tool if you want to display fine-grained system metrics.

See the [Rainmeter Documentation](https://docs.rainmeter.net/) for more info on using and editing rainmeter skins.
